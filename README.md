This repo contains code in support of our forthcoming manuscript, "Reverse Ecology and Metatranscriptomics of Uncultivated Freshwater Actinobacteria." It relies extensively on the reverseEcology Python package, developed for this project. The package is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reverseEcology).
