## Figure 1 (figures/fig1-tree/tree-abbrev.pdf)

&nbsp;

Phylogenetic placement of the SAGs and MAGs within the acI lineage, relative to other sequenced actinobacterial genomes in the class Actinobacteria [@Gao2012]. The tree was built using RAxML [@Stamatakis2014] from a concatenated alignment of single-copy marker genes [@Darling2014]. The class Acidimicrobiia forms the outgroup.
