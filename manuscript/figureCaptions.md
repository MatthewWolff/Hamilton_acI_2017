## Figure 1 (figures/fig1-tree/tree-abbrev.pdf)

&nbsp;

Phylogenetic placement of the SAGs and MAGs within the acI lineage, relative to other sequenced actinobacterial genomes in the class Actinobacteria [@Gao2012]. The tree was built using RAxML [@Stamatakis2014] from a concatenated alignment of single-copy marker genes [@Darling2014]. The class Acidimicrobiia forms the outgroup.

## Figure 2a(b) (figures/fig2-sampling/completeness-2.svg and figures/fig2-sampling/completeness-1.svg)

&nbsp;

Mean estimated completeness of tribe(clade)-level population genomes. For each tribe(clade), genomes were randomly sampled (with replacement) from the set of all genomes belonging to that tribe(clade). Completeness was estimated using single-copy marker genes [@Parks2015]. Error bars represent the 95% confidence estimated from 1000 iterations.
