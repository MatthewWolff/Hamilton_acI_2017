    "An organism's seed set contains all of the metabolites which cannot be synthesized by its metabolic network. They can represent auxotrophies, compounds which can be degraded, and (in many case) errors in the organism's metabolic network. Seed compounds were manually curated to identify those which may be biologically meaningful. Examples of each case (for the acI-C composite genome) will be discussed further below.\n",

    "Many seed compounds were also associated with reactions catalyzed by peptidases or glycoside hydrolases, and genes associated with these reactions were re-annotated. Peptidase sequences were annotated using the MEROPS batch BLAST interface. Glycoside hydrolases were first annotated using dbCAN to assign these genes to glycoside hydrolase families, and HMMER3  was used to assign these genes to individual sub-families using HMMs downloaded from dbCAN."

    "### Checking Compounds for Biological Plausability\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents vignettes presenting the diverse ways in which seed compounds were manually curated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Homoserine Auxotrophy\n",
    "\n",
    "`L-Aspartate-4-semialdehyde`, `L-homoserine`, and `O-Phospho-L-homoserine` were identified as seed compounds. These three compounds can be interconverted via the following reactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Homoserine dehydrogenase: L-Aspartate-4-semialdehyde <--> L-homoserine\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Homoserine kinase: L-homoserine <--> O-Phospho-L-homoserine\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they can be freely interconverted, the three compounds are considered equivalent and any of them could be a seed. `Homoserine dehydrogenase` is the final step in homoserine biosynthesis, so these compounds suggest an auxotrophy for homoserine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Degradation of Peptides\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ala-Leu` and `gly-pro-L` were predicted to be seed compounds. The compounds are associated with the following reactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "        H2O + Ala-Leu --> L-Leucine + L-Alanine\n",
    "        \n",
    "        H2O + Gly-Pro --> Glycine + L-Proline\n",
    "        \n",
    "and the COGs were annotated as various peptidases. These seed compounds suggest the ability to degrade peptides.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Carbamoyl phosphate: A result of network pruning heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Another putative seed compound was carbamoyl phosphate. Carbamoylphosphate synthase is the first step in arginine and pyrmidine biosynthesis, and catalyzes the reactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2 ATP + L-glutamine + hydrogen carbonate + H2O â†’ L-glutamate + carbamoyl phosphate + 2 ADP + phosphate + 2 H+\n",
    "\n",
    "This reaction contains a number of currency metabolites (the P carriers ATP/ADP, the NH3-carriers glutamine and glutamate), as well as the single metabolites carbonate, water, phosphate and protons. All of these metaboliteswere removed from the network during pruning. Thus, all inward arcs to carbamoyl phosphate were removed, rendering it a seed compound. A quick inspection of the genome identified the gene for carbamoylphosphate synthase, confirming this hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fatty acids: A network error\n",
    "\n",
    "Many putative seed compounds participate in fatty acid biosynthesis. For example, the pipeline predicted 26 R-enoyl-ACP compounds to be seed compounds. All 26 compounds were associated with a COG annotated as an `Enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase [NADH] (EC 1.3.1.9)`, the enzyme which catalyzes the final step in fatty acid elongation. Fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis pathways are typically difficult to reconstruct automatically (e.g., using the Model SEED), and these compounds are highly unlikely to be seeds. For acI-C, a total of 29 of 73 putatitve seed compounds participate in fatty acid or lipid biosynthesis, so this is a huge problem!"

    "\n",
    "Automatic metabolic network reconstruction pipelines are prone to errors, such as missing/poor annotations, incorrect reaction assignments, etc. Thus, for each seed compound identified above, I manually inspected the genome for evidence for/against the prediction being a true positive. For the sake of brevity, some typical analyses are presented below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auxotrophy for Homoserine\n",
    "\n",
    "As described above, the seed compound L-Aspartate-4-semialdehyde suggests an auxotrophy for homoserine. Homoserine biosynthesis occurs via the following reactions:\n",

    "    aspartate kinase: aspartate --> L-aspartyl-4-phosphate\n",
    "    aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase: L-aspartyl-4-phosphate --> L-Aspartate-4-semialdehyde\n",
    "    homoserine dehydrogenase: L-Aspartate-4-semialdehyde --> homoserine\n",
    "    \n",
    "The presence of L-Aspartate-4-semialdehyde as a seed compound suggests the reaction `aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase` is missing, and I am unable to identify a candidate gene for this reaction.  However, I can find the other two reactions in the pathway: aspartate kinase (group00288) and homoserine dehydrogenase (group00198), but not `aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase`. Thus, on the evidence available, I conclude acI-C is auxotrophic for homoserine.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Auxotrophy for Threonine\n",
    "\n",
    "The seed compound L-arogenate suggests an auxotrophy for tyrosine. Tyrosine can be synthesized via the following route:\n",
    "\n",
    "    chorismate mutase: chorismate --> prephenate\n",
    "    prephenate aminotransferase: prephanate --> L-arogenate\n",
    "    arogenate dehydrogenase: L-arogenate --> L-tyrosine\n",
    "    \n",
    "L-arogenate was predicted to be a seed compound based on the presence of `arogenate dehydrogenase`, the final step in the pathways. The reaction `chorismate mutase` is also present, and I was unable to find a likely gene for `prephenate aminotransferase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, L-tyrosine can be synthesized from chorismate via an alternative pathway:\n",
    "\n",
    "    chorismate mutase: chorismate --> prephenate\n",
    "    prephenate dehydrogenase: prephenate --> 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate\n",
    "    tyrosine aminotransferase: 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate --> L-tyrosine\n",

I was unable to find any other reactions in the taurine degradation pathway, and BLAST-based annotations suggest these genes are probably `Acyl-CoA reductases`. So taurine is probably not degraded.\n",
