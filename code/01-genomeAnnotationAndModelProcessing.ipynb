To identify such metabolites in KBase, we scanned the ModelSEED [reaction database](https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase/blob/master/Biochemistry/reactions.master.tsv) for metabolites listed in Ma et al [1,2], with the addition of cytochromes and quinones (H+ transfer) and acetyl-CoA/CoA (acetate transfer).
