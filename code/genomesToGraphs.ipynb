To identify such metabolites in KBase, we scanned the ModelSEED [reaction database](https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase/blob/master/Biochemistry/reactions.master.tsv) for metabolites listed in Ma et al, with the addition of cytochromes and quinones (H+ transfer) and acetyl-CoA/CoA (acetate transfer).

This ensures that reactions which synthesize these compounds are retained. The set of such pairs is listed in `data\\externalData\\currencyAminoPairs.txt`.\n",
